Adds a "View" menu to the toolbar with quick links to common admin areas.

== Description ==

I often find myself looking for a quick way to get to the *All Posts*, *All Pages*, etc, screens in the WordPress admin.  

This plugin adds a **View** menu to the toolbar (which replaced the admin bar in WordPress version 3.3) with quick links to these common items. The links are actually identical to the "+ New" menu in the toolbar, except that it goes to the admin archive page. It will also pick up any custom post types you may have added to your site, just like the "+ New" toolbar menu. 

= Options =

There are no plugin options for Toolbar Quick View. You just activate it and it works.
